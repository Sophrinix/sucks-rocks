## DESCRIPTION

[Sucks/Rocks](http://sucks-rocks.com) judges the goodness of terms by searching the web for positive and negative mentions of them.

Its design is intended to illustrate isolated unit testing as well as service-wrapper-record design. Services have no concrete knowledge about the database or external services; records wrap the database, providing the interface that the services need; and wrappers hide details of third-party APIs, narrowing their interfaces to only what the services need.

This application was built test-first as a demonstration, and the full process is viewable as a series of eight Destroy All Software [screencasts](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts).
